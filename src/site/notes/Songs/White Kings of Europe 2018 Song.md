Lyrics:-
🎵 “White Kings of Europe (2018 Song)” 🎵
(To the tune of a triumphant anthem – think Queen's “We Will Rock You” or a stadium-style chant)

[Verse 1]
Back in twenty-eighteen, the kings wore white,
Three in a row, what a glorious sight!
Madrid stood tall, no fear in their game,
Legends were born, they carved out their name.

[Chorus]
🎶 Ohhh Real Madrid!
White shirts blazing, hearts never hid!
Cristiano flying, Ramos the wall,
Isco dancing, they gave it their all!
Ohhh Real Madrid!
Zidane's mind and Modrić’s grace,
They ruled the world from a sacred place! 🎶

[Verse 2]
Marcelo storming up that wing,
Casemiro made the midfield sting,
Benzema’s touch, so calm, so cold,
That team was fire, pure white and gold.

[Bridge]
Kroos was the engine, smooth and precise,
Keylor in goal with those cat-like dives,
Bale off the bench, with a bicycle high,
Liverpool wept, as that ball kissed the sky.

[Chorus]
🎶 Ohhh Real Madrid!
White shirts blazing, hearts never hid!
Cristiano flying, Ramos the wall,
Isco dancing, they gave it their all!
Ohhh Real Madrid!
Zidane’s boys in that final fight,
Lifting the cup on a Kyiv night! 🎶

[Outro]
Threepeat dreams, they made them true,
Legends in white, through and through,
Raise your voice, let’s sing their praise,
Madrid forever, glory days!

🎵 Hala Madrid... y nada más! 🎵
